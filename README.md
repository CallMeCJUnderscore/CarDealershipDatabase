# CarDealershipDatabase
This is the end-of-week workshop for Week 9 of the Fall 2023 Course of the Pluralsight Learn-to-Code Academy.

## Details
This project contains a series of SQL files containing a custom schema, the data to populate said schema, and then several test scripts to show the capabilities of said schema.

## One interesting discovery
Even though I already have experience with SQL, my previous work was with MSSQLSERVER, and so learning the minor differences in syntax was always an interesting rabit hole to fall down. I also learned the specifics of the DATETIME data type, as I had not used that in any capacity before this course.
